<p>Nikola tries fairly hard to be compatible between versions. However, there were
a few areas which were getting clunky, and needed fxing. So, here's what you may
need to change in your site.</p>
<p>If you need to change anything else, or something breaks, please write at nikola-discuss
and I'll add further tweaks here.</p>
<div class="section" id="themes">
<h1>Themes</h1>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>NOTE</strong></dt>
<dd>There is no equivalent for the jinja-default theme yet. If you have a custom,
jinja-based theme, upgrading is probably a bad idea right now.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Themes have been renamed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>site =&gt; bootstrap</li>
<li>orphan =&gt; base</li>
</ul>
<p>Theme added:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>base-jinja</li>
</ul>
<p>Themes have been moved out of nikola and into nikola-themes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>default =&gt; oldfashioned at nikola-themes</li>
<li>jinja-default =&gt; not there yet, coming soon</li>
<li>monospace =&gt; monospace at nikola-themes</li>
<li>site-reveal =&gt; reveal at nikola-themes</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have to change your <tt class="docutils literal">THEME</tt> setting, or change the <tt class="docutils literal">parent</tt> if you are
using a custom theme. Also, some templates have been tweaked, but nothing should
break for you.</p>
<p>Facebook comments support changed the HTML tag to:</p>
<pre><html
%if comment_system == 'facebook':
xmlns:fb="http://ogp.me/ns/fb#"
%endif
lang="${lang}"></pre><p>If you do not want to use Facebook comments, you can leave the old <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;html
<span class="pre">lang=&quot;${lang}&quot;&gt;</span></tt> tag in and it will work just fine.</p>
<div class="section" id="comments">
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>If you want a custom theme to support comment systems other than disqus, you will need to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Replace mentions of disqus_helper.tmpl with comments_helper.tmpl</li>
<li>Replace mentions of html_disqus with comment_form</li>
<li>Replace mentions of html_disqus_link with comment_link</li>
<li>Replace mentions of html_disqus_script with comment_link_script</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't, your theme should work just fine, but support only disqus comments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration">
<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>A number of options have been renamed. In most cases, the behaviour
should be <strong>exactly</strong> as before.</p>
<p>However, <tt class="docutils literal">post_pages</tt> was split into <tt class="docutils literal">POSTS</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">PAGES</tt>.  Long
story short, anything that had a <tt class="docutils literal">True</tt> as the <tt class="docutils literal">use_in_feeds</tt>
(last) value goes to <tt class="docutils literal">POSTS</tt> and anything with <tt class="docutils literal">False</tt> goes to
<tt class="docutils literal">PAGES</tt>.  For example:</p>
<pre>post_pages = (
    ("posts/*.txt", "", "post.tmpl", True),
    ("stories/*.txt", "p", "story.tmpl", False),
    ("stories/*.html", "s", "story.tmpl", False),
)

### becomes ###

POSTS = (
    ("posts/*.txt", "", "post.tmpl"),
)

PAGES = (
    ("stories/*.txt", "p", "story.tmpl"),
    ("stories/*.html", "s", "story.tmpl"),
)</pre><p>Also, you will get warnings. That doesn't mean things broke. They are
there to inform you of what's happening, and that you need to tweak your
config.</p>
<p>All the deprecated options will work during the v6 cycle, and only be
removed in v7, when those warnings will become errors.</p>
</div>
